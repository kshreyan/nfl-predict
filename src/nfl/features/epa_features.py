"""Leak-free trailing EPA (expected points added) features -- the single
most predictive public NFL metric per the project brief, and until now
entirely missing from this system.

Two-stage, both leak-free:
  1. Aggregate play-by-play to one row per (game, team): offensive EPA/play,
     defensive EPA/play allowed, success rate, split by pass/rush. This
     stage only ever looks *within* a single game (no leakage risk).
  2. Roll that game-level table forward chronologically per team, exactly
     like features/rolling_scoring.py: the trailing value attached to a
     game is computed only from that team's games strictly before it.

Source: nflverse play-by-play via nfl_data_py.import_pbp_data. `play == 1`
is nflverse's own flag for "this row counts as a real play" (excludes
timeouts, penalties-only, spikes counted separately, etc.) -- filtering on
it (not just play_type) is what nflverse's own EPA leaderboards do.
