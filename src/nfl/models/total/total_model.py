"""Walk-forward game-total (points) model.

Predicts total points as Normal(mean, sigma) so over/under probability
against any market total line can be derived from the CDF. Leak-free:
features are trailing scoring averages (see rolling_scoring.py, itself
leak-free), and the regression mapping those features -> total points is
fit only on strictly-prior-season data, expanding window.
